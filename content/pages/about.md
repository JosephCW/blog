Hello!

My name is Joseph Watts, and I'm a professional software engineer with a love for technology. My current strengths are within backend development using Python.

I earned my Bachelors in Computer Science in late 2019 from Northwest Missouri State University, and am currently employed at EquipmentShare as a software engineer.


This blog is about me, projects I am working on, and useful notes that may save someone else the hassle of troubleshooting something.
