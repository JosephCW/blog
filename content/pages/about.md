Hello!

My name is Joseph Watts, and I'm a professional software engineer based out of Kansas City, MO. I'm passonate about technology and always looking to learn new things. My current strengths lie within backend development using Python on AWS.

I earned my Bachelors in Computer Science in late 2019 from Northwest Missouri State University, and am currently employed at EquipmentShare as a software engineer.

This blog is about me, projects I am working on, and useful notes that may save someone else the hassle of troubleshooting something.
